## Learning Notes  
## Step 1 - VirtualBox Installation
### What I Did
Successfully installed and launched Oracle VirtualBox.
### What I Learned
I learned that virtualization allows me to run multiple operating systems on one physical computer. Oracle VirtualBox will be used throughout this project to build a safe Active Directory lab without affecting my main Windows installation.

## Step 2 - Windows Server 2022 ISO
### What I Did
Downloaded the Windows Server 2022 Evaluation ISO from Microsoft.
### What I Learned
I learned that an ISO file contains the installation media required to install an operating system. I will use this Windows Server 2022 Evaluation ISO inside VirtualBox to build a realistic Active Directory lab environment.

## Step 3 - Windows Server Installation Complete
### What I Did
Successfully installed Windows Server 2022 and verified that the server booted to the Windows desktop.
### What I Learned
I learned how to deploy a Windows Server operating system inside a virtual machine. This server will later be promoted to a Domain Controller and will host Active Directory Domain Services for the lab.

## Step 4 - Server Manager Dashboard
### What I Did
Opened Server Manager after the first login and confirmed the installation completed successfully.
### What I Learned
I learned that Server Manager is the primary management console used to configure Windows Server. It allows administrators to install server roles and features, monitor the server, and manage services such as Active Directory.

## Step 5 - Rename Server to DC01
### What I Did
Renamed the Windows Server computer name from the default hostname to **DC01** and verified the change in Server Manager.
### What I Learned
I learned that using a descriptive server name makes administration easier and helps identify the server's role within the network. Naming the server DC01 prepares it for its role as the Domain Controller.

## Step 6 - Create Domain Controller
### What I Did
Installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), promoted the server to a Domain Controller, created a new forest named company.local, and verified that DC01 appeared in the Domain Controllers container within Active Directory Users and Computers.
### What I Learned
I learned that a Domain Controller stores and manages Active Directory data, authenticates users and computers, and provides centralized administration for a Windows domain. Promoting the server to a Domain Controller created the company.local domain and prepared the environment for user, group, and policy management.

## Step 7 - Create Organizational Units
### What I Did
Created Organizational Units named Employees, IT, HR, and Finance within Active Directory Users and Computers.
### What I Learned
I learned that Organizational Units (OUs) are used to logically organize Active Directory objects. OUs allow administrators to group users and computers by department and simplify management, delegation, and Group Policy deployment.

## Step 8 - Create Users 
### What I Did
Created user accounts within the IT, HR, and Finance Organizational Units and verified that each account appeared correctly in Active Directory Users and Computers.
### What I Learned
I learned that user accounts can be organized within Organizational Units (OUs) to reflect departmental structures. This makes user administration easier and allows administrators to apply permissions, policies, and management tasks to specific groups of users.

## Step 9 - Create Security Groups
### What I Did
Created security groups named **IT_Users**, **HR_Users**, and **Finance_Users** within Active Directory Users and Computers. Added the appropriate departmental user accounts to each group and verified that the memberships were configured correctly.
### What I Learned
I learned that Security Groups are used to simplify permission management in Active Directory. Instead of assigning permissions to individual users, administrators can assign permissions to groups, making access control easier to manage and maintain.

## Step 10 - Reset User Passwords
### What I Did
Reset passwords for user accounts in the Finance, HR, and IT Organizational Units using Active Directory Users and Computers. Verified that each password reset was completed successfully for the selected user accounts.
### What I Learned
I learned how to reset user passwords in Active Directory and manage user credentials within a domain environment. This task demonstrated how administrators can assist users who forget their passwords while maintaining account security and ensuring continued access to network resources.

# Step 11 - Disable User Accounts
### What I Did
I disabled a user account in each department Organizational Unit (Finance, HR, and IT) using Active Directory Users and Computers. I selected a user from each department and used the Disable Account option to prevent access to domain resources.
### What I Learned
I learned how to disable Active Directory user accounts without deleting them. Disabling accounts is useful when access needs to be temporarily revoked while preserving user information and permissions.

# Step 12 – Create Windows 10 Client
## What I Did
I installed Windows 10 on the Client Virtual Machine using the Windows 10 ISO file in Oracle VirtualBox. During the installation process, I configured the regional settings, selected the Windows edition, accepted the licence agreement, chose the installation type, selected the virtual hard disk, and initiated the operating system installation.
## What I Learned
I learned how to deploy a Windows 10 operating system within a virtualised environment using Oracle VirtualBox. I gained practical experience with the Windows Setup wizard, operating system selection, storage configuration, and the installation stages required to prepare a client machine for use within an Active Directory environment.
